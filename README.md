# Piano-Practice-Program
A program designed to help with piano chord practice. In its proposed use, it takes in user input (being integrated into keyboard hardware; input represents trials at successfully playing prompted chords). Then, logistic regression is used to prioritise chords needing practiced most by the user. Simulations then carried out emulating user learning.
